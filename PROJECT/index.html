    <h2>your horoscope for the full moon in virgo</h2>
<p> Full Moons are a time for releasing and relinquishing. If you have an excess in your life, this is the time<br> for it to go down the drain. Through silent meditation, exchanging of thoughts, or spiritual practice, Full Moons are a a point when we can let go.

    How do you pick yourself up after a natural disaster? My hometown in southwest Florida and the communities that surround us are still recovering from Hurricane Ian. <br>When so-called “acts of God” occur, there is nowhere to place blame, no matter how much we try to make sense of things. The absence of a reason can leave us searching for an explanation.
    
    On August 7, 2023, at 7:40 AM EST, the Full Moon will hide behind the Earth, directly opposing the Sun in Pisces.<br> When the Moon is farthest from the rays of the Sun, it has the space to breathe, emote, and take off her mask.<br> When disaster strikes, whether natural or not, the response might be an impulse to solve problems. <br>But the Full Moon in Virgo urges us to take time to rest and be still. My challenge to you during this Full Moon is to reflect on how you mourn. Write it down if you can.</p>
